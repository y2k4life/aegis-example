/**
 * An actor is implemented as a nodejs worker thread (aka service worker in browserland).
 * By default, its only capability is to send and receive messages (to and from the
 * parent thread).
 *
 *
 * A model implements the Aegis ModelSpecfication API and its lifecycle is controlled by
 * an auto-generated set of CRUD APIs. Think of a model as an entity, like a record in a table.
